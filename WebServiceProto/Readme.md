### WebServiceProto

This is an example Data Interactive that can be a starting point for Interactives
that fetch and filter data from a web service and convey it to CODAP for data
analysis. 
Examples of existing fetch and filter interactives include the Ocean Tracks 
Track Selector and the Log Manager.
